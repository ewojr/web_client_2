# Password Depot Web Client

A modern web client for **Password Depot Enterprise Server**, built as a Single Page Application (SPA) that communicates with the PD Server exclusively via the REST API v2.0.

> 📖 **REST API documentation** — the Password Depot Server REST API v2.0 contract this client targets is documented at **https://github.com/acebit-gmbh/pd_rest_api**.

## Overview

The web client provides browser-based access to Password Depot vaults with support for:

- **Vault browsing** -- folder tree navigation, entry list with sorting, detail panel
- **Full CRUD** -- create, edit, move, and delete entries and folders
- **12 entry types** -- password, credit card, license, identity, information, banking, document, RDP, PuTTY, TeamViewer, custom, passkey (custom entries render with the password layout)
- **Document management** -- upload and download file attachments (up to 64 MB)
- **Search** -- full-text search across entries
- **6 authentication methods** -- Standard, SSPI, Windows SSO (Negotiate), Passkey (WebAuthn), OIDC, Azure AD
- **Two-factor authentication** -- TOTP setup and verification
- **Second password protection** -- per-entry/folder unlock with session caching
- **Session management** -- 10-minute inactivity timeout with warning, auto-logout
- **Responsive design** -- desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts
- **Internationalization** -- English and German (French, Spanish, Dutch planned)
- **Theming** -- light, dark, and system-preference modes

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20 or later
- **npm** 10 or later (ships with Node.js 20+)
- **Password Depot Enterprise Server** 19.x running with REST API v2.0 enabled

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure the development proxy

Point the dev-server proxy at your PD Server with an environment variable — no need to edit tracked source. Copy the example file and set the target:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# then edit .env.local:
#   DEV_PROXY_TARGET=https://your-pd-server:8714
```

`npm run dev` forwards the `/v2.0`, `/file`, and `/temp` routes to `DEV_PROXY_TARGET` (defaults to `https://localhost:8714` when unset). The `/file` route serves entry icons in development — it must be proxied or custom icons will 404.

`.env.local` is gitignored, and `DEV_PROXY_TARGET` is **not** `VITE_`-prefixed, so it never reaches the client bundle. The dev proxy accepts the server's self-signed/private TLS certificate (`secure: false` in `vite.config.ts`); the production client always uses HTTPS against a properly-presented certificate.

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The web client is available at `http://localhost:5173`. API requests to `/v2.0/*` are proxied to the PD Server.

### 4. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is in the `dist/` directory -- static files ready to be served by any web server or bundled with the PD Server.

### 5. Preview the production build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## All npm Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | TypeScript check + Vite production build |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run format` | Format source files with Prettier |
| `npm run test` | Run Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run test:run` | Run Vitest once (CI-friendly) |

## Deployment Modes

The web client supports three deployment modes, controlled by `public/config.json`:

### Bundled (planned)

> **Not yet available.** Bundled mode requires the PD Server to serve static web-root files (the SPA `index.html` and assets), which the current server build does not implement — its HTTP listener only serves the `/v2.0`, `/v1.0`, `/file`, `/temp`, and `/shared` routes. Until that lands, deploy the web client in **Custom Server** or **Cloud Hosted** mode (below). The initial public rollout is cloud-hosted.

When supported, the compiled SPA is shipped as static files served by the PD Server itself. Same-origin deployment eliminates CORS issues and enables Windows SSO (Negotiate) out of the box.

```json
{
  "bundled": true
}
```

The server connection fields are hidden. All API calls use relative URLs (`/v2.0/...`).

### Custom Server

The web client is hosted separately (e.g., on a corporate web server) and connects to a PD Server specified by the user or pre-configured.

```json
{
  "bundled": false,
  "defaultServer": "pd-server.example.com",
  "defaultPort": "8714"
}
```

Requires CORS headers on the PD Server (configured in Server Manager).

### Cloud Hosted

Hosted at a public URL (e.g., `web.password-depot.de`) where each user connects to their own PD Server. No defaults are pre-filled.

```json
{
  "bundled": false,
  "defaultServer": "",
  "defaultPort": "8714"
}
```

## Configuration

### config.json

Place `config.json` in the `public/` directory (development) or alongside `index.html` (production). All fields are optional -- defaults are used for missing fields.

```json
{
  "bundled": false,
  "defaultServer": "",
  "defaultPort": "8714",
  "defaultAuthMethod": "standard",
  "disabledAuthModes": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `bundled` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, the web client is served by the PD Server (same origin) |
| `defaultServer` | string | `""` | Pre-filled server address (empty = user must enter) |
| `defaultPort` | string | `"8714"` | Default port number |
| `defaultAuthMethod` | string | `"standard"` | Default authentication method in the selector |
| `disabledAuthModes` | string[] | `[]` | Auth methods to hide (e.g., `["negotiate", "azure"]`) |

Valid values for `defaultAuthMethod` and `disabledAuthModes`: `"standard"`, `"sspi"`, `"negotiate"`, `"webauthn"`, `"oidc"`, `"azure"`.

### User Preferences

User preferences (language, theme, last-used server, last-used auth method, etc.) are stored in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `pd-options`. No sensitive data (passwords, second passwords) is ever stored in `localStorage`. The access token is held in tab-scoped `sessionStorage` (key `pd-auth`) so it survives an accidental refresh; it is cleared on logout and tab close (see "Security Model" below).

## Authentication Methods

### Standard (Username & Password)

Default method. User enters username and password, which are sent to `POST /v2.0/auth/login` with `auth: "standard"`.

### SSPI (Domain Login)

Kerberos/NTLM authentication with explicit domain credentials. User enters credentials in UPN format (`user@domain.com`) or down-level format (`DOMAIN\username`). Sent with `auth: "sspi"`.

### Windows SSO (Negotiate)

Passwordless authentication using the browser's HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO/Kerberos) mechanism. The browser automatically sends the user's Windows credentials -- no username or password input required.

**Requirements:**

- The PD Server must have Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) enabled
- The PD user must have the IWA auth method enabled with SAM or UPN populated
- The client machine must be domain-joined
- The browser must be configured to allow Negotiate authentication to the server (see below)

**Bundled mode:** Works out of the box if the server is in the browser's Local Intranet zone (same origin is typically trusted automatically).

**Cross-origin mode:** Requires the server to send proper CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` with a specific origin, not `*`), and the browser must be configured to trust the server.

#### Configuring Google Chrome for Negotiate

Chrome requires an explicit policy to allow Negotiate authentication. Set the `AuthServerAllowlist` policy via the Windows Registry.

**Run as Administrator:**

```cmd
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome" /v AuthServerAllowlist /t REG_SZ /d "your-pd-server.example.com" /f
```

Multiple servers can be comma-separated. Wildcards are supported:

```cmd
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome" /v AuthServerAllowlist /t REG_SZ /d "*.example.com,pd-server.local" /f
```

**Restart Chrome** after setting the policy. Verify at `chrome://policy` -- the `AuthServerAllowlist` entry should appear.

#### Configuring Microsoft Edge for Negotiate

Edge uses the same policy name but under a different registry key:

```cmd
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge" /v AuthServerAllowlist /t REG_SZ /d "your-pd-server.example.com" /f
```

**Restart Edge** after setting the policy. Verify at `edge://policy`.

#### Domain-Wide Deployment via Group Policy

For enterprise environments, use Group Policy instead of manual registry edits:

1. Open **Group Policy Management Console** (`gpmc.msc`)
2. Navigate to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Google Chrome** (or **Microsoft Edge**)
3. Enable **Authentication server allowlist**
4. Enter the PD Server hostname(s)

The Chrome/Edge ADMX templates must be installed. Download from:

- **Chrome:** https://chromeenterprise.google/browser/download/
- **Edge:** https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download

### Passkey (WebAuthn / FIDO2)

Passwordless authentication using biometric or hardware security keys. The user enters their username, then the browser's native passkey dialog appears.

**Note:** The web client supports passkey **login** (assertion) as well as passkey **registration and management** from the user profile panel (via `/me/passkeys/*`). Passkeys registered in the native Password Depot client and in the web client are interchangeable. (Registration requires the WebAuthn auth method to be enabled for the user on the server.)

### Identity Provider (OIDC)

OpenID Connect authentication via configured identity providers (Ping Identity, Entra ID, Auth0, generic OIDC). The available providers are fetched from the PD Server via `GET /v2.0/auth/oidc` and cached locally.

**Setup:**

1. Configure the OIDC provider in PD Server Manager
2. Register the web client's **base URL** (origin only — no path) as a valid redirect URI in the identity provider's app registration. Because the app uses hash-based routing, the route lives in the URL fragment, so the redirect URI is the base URL, **not** a `/login` path:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173/`
   - Production: `https://your-web-client-host/`

   > The provider must include `id_token` in its allowed response types (the web client requests `id_token`, since the PD Server validates an id_token/access token rather than exchanging an authorization code). A provider configured for `code`-only response types will fail after the IdP round-trip.

### Azure AD / Entra ID (Deprecated)

Legacy Microsoft authentication using a fixed application client ID (`4d0af5fb-060c-40d5-bbf5-8b59f50d47ed`). This method is maintained for backward compatibility -- new deployments should use OIDC with an Entra ID provider instead.

The web client's URL must be registered as a redirect URI in the Azure AD app registration for the above application ID.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA is handled transparently for all authentication methods:

- **HTTP 459** -- 2FA not yet activated. The web client displays the QR code for authenticator app setup, then prompts for the 6-digit code.
- **HTTP 460** -- 2FA code required. The web client prompts for the 6-digit verification code.

The full original login request (including OIDC/Azure tokens) is preserved and resent with the `tfacode` field appended.

## Security Model

- **Server-side decryption** -- the API returns plaintext data over HTTPS. No client-side cryptography is needed.
- **HTTPS-only transport** -- the client always builds the API origin with the `https://` scheme; user-supplied server addresses are sanitized to strip any scheme prefix or path so the connection cannot be downgraded.
- **Tab-scoped token storage** -- the access token is held in a Zustand store backed by `sessionStorage` (key `pd-auth`). It survives a page refresh in the same tab so the user does not lose their session on accidental F5, and it is cleared on logout, on tab close, and after 10 minutes of server-side inactivity. It is never written to `localStorage` or cookies. Logout fans out across all open tabs via a `BroadcastChannel`, so signing out in one tab also clears the others.
- **10-minute session timeout** -- the server invalidates the token after 10 minutes of inactivity. Each API call resets the timer. The web client shows a warning at 8 minutes and auto-logs out at 10.
- **Second password** -- entries and folders protected with a second password require an additional password prompt. The second password is sent via the `X-Second-Password` header (Base64-encoded) and cached in memory for the session duration.
- **OIDC / Azure callback validation** -- the OAuth `state` and `nonce` values are generated with `crypto.getRandomValues`. On callback the `state` is verified against the value saved during the authorization request, and when the IdP returns an `id_token` directly its `nonce` claim is verified before the token is forwarded to the PD Server. Error callbacks are only honored when an OIDC flow is actually in progress, and only the machine-readable error code (never the IdP's free-text description) is shown, to prevent text-injection via crafted `?error=` links.
- **No-store responses** -- API requests are issued with `cache: 'no-store'` so entry-detail responses (which contain plaintext passwords) are never written to the browser's persistent disk cache.
- **Content-Security-Policy** -- `index.html` ships a baseline CSP meta tag (`object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, scoped `connect-src`, etc.). For standalone/cloud deployments, **also serve a stricter nonce/hash-based CSP as a real HTTP header** at your web server (a meta tag cannot set `frame-ancestors`, and a static tag can't carry a per-build nonce), and tighten `connect-src` to your specific PD Server origin.

### API Constraints

- **No flat entry list** -- browsing is exclusively via `/children` endpoints (folder tree navigation)
- **No server-side sorting** -- the client implements sorting locally
- **Compact vs. full representations** -- list endpoints return compact objects (no passwords); detail endpoints return full objects
- **Pagination** -- all list endpoints support `offset` and `limit` query parameters

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development setup, coding conventions, and the pull-request checklist. In short: keep the API layering intact, add user-facing strings to **both** `en.json` and `de.json`, and make sure `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:run` pass before opening a PR.

## Security

This is a client for a password manager, so security reports are taken seriously. **Please do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities** — follow the responsible-disclosure process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
